Capture the flag is a gamemode for [SA-MP](https://www.sa-mp.com/) created with [sampsharp.net](https://github.com/ikkentim/SampSharp)

The gamemode is based on capture the flag and then the player must bring the flag to the base for his team to earn score.

In this video you can find a demo of how the gamemode is looking: https://youtu.be/9Ban7Wkhqq4
