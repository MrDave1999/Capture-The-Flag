Capture the flag is a gamemode for [SA-MP](https://www.sa-mp.com/) created with [sampsharp](https://github.com/ikkentim/SampSharp)

Capture the flag is a style of play in which two teams try to catch a flag and carry it to a certain location to score points.
To play, players are divided into two teams (Alpha and Beta), each on a field. To earn points, you must capture the flag and take it to a certain location.
Currently, the game mode consists of 19 maps and every 20 minutes a map change is made.

In this video you can find a demo of how the gamemode is looking: https://youtu.be/9Ban7Wkhqq4
